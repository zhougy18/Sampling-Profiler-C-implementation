# Sampling-Profiler-C-implementation
A sampling profiler probes the target program's call stack at regular intervals using operating system interrupts.
This project is used for demonstrating how to profile a program by sampling and has been tested on a Ubuntu 16.04 x86-64 machine.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Please first install "libunwind" library from "www.nongnu.org/libunwind/download.html".
### Installing
```
gcc -o main main.c hotspots_sampling.c -lunwind -lunwind-x86_64
```
or just
```
make
```
## Running the tests
sample at 500Hz
```
./main 500
```
## Output
sample frequency: 500 Hz
